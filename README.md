The project was developed for Data Warehouses and Analytical Processing laboratories at Poznan University of Technology.

It aims to predict electricity consumption based on past observations and weather features. Data was collected from Bia≈Çogard energy grid.

Two approaches have been tested. First involded using classic SARIMA model, but due to its low accurracy, neural network has been chosen. It was fed with past observations, significantly correlated with the value to be predicted, weather and date features.
